This be version 0.1.

Enjoy this simple but pretty neat smooth page scroller. I built this
after doing a search for one only to come up with some complicated
solutions. This one is short and sweet and super easy to modify.

**REQUIRES JQUERY**

Usage:
<a href="javascript:goto('elementname', topamount, duration)">Stuff</a>
